ChrisList: The Alternative to CraigsList

This was the final group project by myself and three classmates from The Software Guild. All listings are fake
and purely for the sake of demonstrating the function of the site.

Feel free to explore. The users "user" and "admin" both have a password of "password".

Make sure to run the chrisListDB.sql file beforehand (and the christLIstDBTest.sql file for the tests to pass 
during the build).

Email me at aaron.thompson.mn@gmail.com with any comments or questions.
Sincerely,
Aaron
