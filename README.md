Blackjack, openWeather, ChrisList were some of my first side-projects as a developer.

Benchmark was used to test execution times of various Java constructs and I keep it available as a template for future benchmark testing.

My biggest project, fartlek (Swedish for "speed-play", as I was just playing around when I started it), was initially built on vanilla javascript and jQuery. The backend was built with Spring Boot and Java utilizing object-oriented design, JDBC, etc. The front-end was later refactored to use React and was in production for my team of runners for about a year before I discontinued it in favor of Strava. The create-account and login pages still work as they interact with AWS' Cognito for Identity Access Management; any client-side scripting is still functional (toggling between mobile and desktop screen sizes, for example), but any functionality that requires integration with the back-end is unavailable as the java API has been terminated. Please see the "Fartlek-React" directory for a code sample (note it will not build as AWS credentials have been removed from the configuration). Check it out at www.fartlek.us.

I continue to add any projects related to ongoing coursework and that I deem helpful for future projects. Thanks for taking the time to read this :)
