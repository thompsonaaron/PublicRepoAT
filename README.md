Blackjack, openWeather were some of my first side-projects as a developer.

My biggest project, fartlek (Swedish for "speed-play", as I was just playing around when I started it), was initially built on vanilla javascript and jQuery with a Java API on the backend. It was later refactored to use React and was in production for my team of runners for about a year before I discontinued it in favor of Strava. The skeleton of the application is still visible, although the API is no longer running on AWS. Check it out at www.fartlek.us.
