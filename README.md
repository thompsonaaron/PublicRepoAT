Blackjack, openWeather, ChrisList were some of my first side-projects as a developer.

Benchmark was used to test execution times of various Java constructs and I keep it available as a template for future benchmark testing.

My biggest project, fartlek (Swedish for "speed-play", as I was just playing around when I started it), was initially built on vanilla javascript and jQuery. The backend was built with Spring Boot and Java utilizing object-oriented design, JDBC, etc. The front-end was later refactored to use React and was in production for my team of runners for about a year before I discontinued it in favor of Strava. The DNS has since lapsed and it is no longer hosted on AWS :(

I continue to add any projects related to ongoing coursework and that I deem helpful for future projects, recent starter projects cover topics including:
- astro and preact (which were used to build a static site for a local high school sports team; see www.moundsviewxc.com)
- MongoDB (as a follow along to MongoDB - The Complete Developer's Guide 2023 on Udemy, by Maximillian Schwarzmuller
- tailwind css
